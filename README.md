# IceHub

## Epilogue

It is a [DirectConnect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_(protocol)) (DC) Server
implemented in Delphi 7 back in 2007 by [@ilblackdragon](https://github.com/ilblackdragon) and me
([@frol](https://github.com/frol)) when we were high-school students.

I publish it here just for my personal backup and don't recommend anyone using it in production.
The server was handling our local hub for ~100 people and was quite stable from what I remember.
We did not use any version control system and merged the changes manually, so you can see some
temporary files right there (I publish the whole folder as is).

`IceHub.exe` is the executable file you needed to run the server, and it is only 1.6MB on disk
and just a few MB in RAM when operating (I am looking at you Electron-based-app in 2020).
